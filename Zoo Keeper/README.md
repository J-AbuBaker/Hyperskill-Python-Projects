# Zookeeper with Python

Welcome to the Zookeeper project!
Help the local zoo take care of its animals by building a tool to keep an eye on them.

## Stages

The project progresses through four stages, each adding new functionality to the Bill Splitter tool:

1. [Rush into print](https://hyperskill.org/projects/98/stages/539/implement)
2. [Show me an animal!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/98/stages/540/implement)
3. [What's inside?](https://hyperskill.org/projects/98/stages/541/implement)
4. [Sustainable care <3](https://hyperskill.org/projects/98/stages/542/implement)
