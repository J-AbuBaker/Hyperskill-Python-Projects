# Last Pencil Game

Welcome to the Last Pencil project from Hyperskill's Python Core course! This game is a simple yet engaging strategy game that you can play with any number of pencils. The objective is to force your opponent to take the last pencil. The game follows some basic rules:

- You can specify the number of pencils at the beginning of the game.
- On each move, you must take at least one pencil and no more than three pencils.
- The game alternates between players, and each player takes turns removing pencils.
- The player who takes the last pencil loses the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Specify the number of pencils to begin the game.
2. **Choose the First Player**: Decide whether you or the bot will start the game.
3. **Make Your Move**: On each turn, select 1, 2, or 3 pencils to remove from the remaining pool.
4. **Alternate Turns**: Continue taking turns until there are no more pencils left.
5. **Winning**: The player who forces their opponent to take the last pencil wins the game.
