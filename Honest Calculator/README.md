# Honest Calculator

Welcome to the Honest Calculator project from Hyperskill! This project challenges you to assemble an application based on a flowchart provided by the International Union Against Idleness (IUAI). The goal is to create a motivational calculator that not only performs calculations but also provides users with encouraging messages along the way.
