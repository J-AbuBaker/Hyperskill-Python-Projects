# Simple Chat Bot with Python

Welcome to the Simple Chat Bot project! In this project, you'll create a console-based chat bot from scratch using Python. This chat bot will communicate with you and perform basic arithmetic operations, guess your age, count, and even play a simple quiz with you.

## Overview

The Simple Chat Bot project is an excellent opportunity to dive into Python programming while building a fun and interactive application. You'll start by creating a basic chat bot that introduces itself and gradually add more features, such as age guessing, counting, and quiz playing, to make the bot more engaging and entertaining.


## Stages

The project progresses through five stages, each adding new functionality to the chat bot:

1. [Meet Your Chat Bot](https://hyperskill.org/projects/97/stages/534/implement)
2. [Introduce Yourself](https://hyperskill.org/projects/97/stages/535/implement)
3. [Let the Chat Bot Guess Your Age](https://hyperskill.org/projects/97/stages/536/implement)
4. [Teach Your Bot to Count](https://hyperskill.org/projects/97/stages/537/implement)
5. [Play a Simple Quiz Together](https://hyperskill.org/projects/97/stages/538/implement)
